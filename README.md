# SMARAG: Self-decisive Multi-Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation for Carbon Reporting
**Overview**

This repository provides the data sources and analytical codes for the SMARAG project, an AI-enhanced carbon reporting framework.
SMARAG leverages multi-agentic systems and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to improve accuracy, efficiency, and security in corporate and institutional carbon reporting.

The purpose of this repository is to enable open access for researchers, policymakers, companies, and other stakeholders who wish to explore, reproduce, or extend the SMARAG workflow.
