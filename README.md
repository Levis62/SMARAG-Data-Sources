# SMARAG: Self-decisive Multi-Agent Retrieval Augmented Generation for Carbon Reporting
**Overview**

This repository provides the data sources and analytical codes for the SMARAG project, an AI-powered carbon reporting system.
SMARAG leverages multi-agentic systems and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to improve accuracy, efficiency, and security in corporate and institutional carbon reporting.

The purpose of this repository is to enable open access for researchers, policymakers, companies, and other stakeholders who wish to explore, reproduce, or extend the SMARAG workflow.
The data sources and analytical codes of SMARAG. Notably, due to the file size limit in GitHub, some files are uploaded separately.

**Data Sources**

1. US EPA Simplified Guides for carbon reporting
2. Sustainability/Carbon Reporting Standards (e.g., CDP, TCFD, GRI, etc.)
3. Cornell Climate Action Plans
4. Cornell GHG Reports
5. Cornell Annual Progress Evaluation


**Analytical codes**
1. The analytical codes of the SMARAG performance evaluation
